# Intro

This is a simple Neural Network project which can predict the handwritten digit.

## Model

The model is a simple feed-forward neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. It has:

1. 2 layers
2. 50 neurons per layer
3. Pre-trained weights for fast and accurate predictions.

# 🚀 Installation

## Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satyamm14/handwritten-digit-recognition-system.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition-system
```

2. Ensure you have PyTorch installed: Install PyTorch based on your system and CUDA availability:

```bash
# For CPU
pip install torch torchvision

# Or for GPU
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

3. Run the app: Launch the application by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

# 📂 Project Structure

### Here's a quick overview of the files and folders in this project:

1. main.py: The main application code (Tkinter-based UI).
2. model/: Contains the pre-trained model and supporting files.
3. README.md: You’re reading it! 😉
